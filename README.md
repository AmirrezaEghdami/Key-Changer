A simple Key-Changer that coded by python.

## The story of how the Key-Changer was made
My uncle gave me a keyboard. But some keys of this keyboard like ctrl and shift did not work. Of course, I had my own keyboard and I did not intend to use the keyboard that my uncle gave me. But I wanted to find a way to solve the problem. After some time it occurred to me that I can use the replaced keys. I wanted to replace the keys that were not working with other keys that are used less. And this is how this program was created.
